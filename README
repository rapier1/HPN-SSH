THE FOLLOWING few lines are message from the developer of hpn-ssh. It is not part
of the README file for OpenSSH.

HOWDY ALL! I hate doing this but I realize that I’ve been working on HPN-SSH for
almost 13 years now. Initially I was funded by a generous grant from Cisco, the NSF,
and NIH. That money is long long gone by now and I can only work on HPN-SSH when I
have the time. *IF* I can get some donations to the project at
http://www.psc.edu/index.php/hpn-sshit would let me free up more cycles to work on it.
Keep in mind that I don’t get any money from the donations. It all goes to support
the work of PSC (see psc.edu). However, if I can get some donations I’d have the
back up I need to demand time to work on it. Now, that being said, if you want to
support me directly I do have a wishlist at amazon http://amzn.com/w/34XO95A1A9CJL

I don’t really expect anyone to buy me things or donate money.
It’s not why I’ve spent a whole lot of hours working on this.
I just thought I’d throw it out there.

This is the port of OpenBSD's excellent OpenSSH[0] to Linux and other
Unices.

OpenSSH is based on the last free version of Tatu Ylonen's sample
implementation with all patent-encumbered algorithms removed (to
external libraries), all known security bugs fixed, new features
reintroduced and many other clean-ups.  OpenSSH has been created by
Aaron Campbell, Bob Beck, Markus Friedl, Niels Provos, Theo de Raadt,
and Dug Song. It has a homepage at https://www.openssh.com/

This port consists of the re-introduction of autoconf support, PAM
support, EGD/PRNGD support and replacements for OpenBSD library
functions that are (regrettably) absent from other unices. This port
has been best tested on AIX, Cygwin, HP-UX, Linux, MacOS/X,
FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, OpenServer, Solaris and UnixWare.

This version actively tracks changes in the OpenBSD CVS repository.

The PAM support is now more functional than the popular packages of
commercial ssh-1.2.x. It checks "account" and "session" modules for
all logins, not just when using password authentication.

There is now several mailing lists for this port of OpenSSH. Please
refer to https://www.openssh.com/list.html for details on how to join.

Please send bug reports and patches to https://bugzilla.mindrot.org or
the mailing list openssh-unix-dev@mindrot.org.  To mitigate spam, the
list only allows posting from subscribed addresses.  Code contribution
are welcomed, but please follow the OpenBSD style guidelines[1].

Please refer to the INSTALL document for information on dependencies and
how to install OpenSSH on your system.

Miscellania -

This version of OpenSSH is based upon code retrieved from the OpenBSD CVS
repository which in turn was based on the last free sample implementation
released by Tatu Ylonen.
